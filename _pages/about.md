<p><b> A Fourth-year Undergraduate Student </b></p>
<p><i> School of Optical and Electronic Information @ Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) </i></p>

Welcome! I’m Yushu Wang, born in May 2004 in Hubei, China. Currently I’m a fourth-year undergraduate student at HUST, advised by [Prof. Chao Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37088353491) and [Prof. Jiahui Peng](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/pengjiahui/en/index.htm). I'm working on quantum optical neuromorphic computing at micro/nano scale now. <b>My ambition is to develop a quantum optical neuromorphic computing system possessing compactness and compatibility of a real brain!</b>

<b>I'd like to invite you to check my [Research Page](https://yushuwang.top/research/). I'm always glad to share my excitement of Quantum Optical Intelligence with you :) </b>

This website is under continuous construction, more documents and recent progress coming soon!
