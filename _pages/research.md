<p>My journey in optical computing began with: <a href="#Section1">Optical Matrices for Coherent Ising Machine</a>, a continuous work is on <a href="#Section2">Two-dimensional Quantum Walk Reservoir Computing</a>.</p>

My aspiration: <b>to develop a quantum optical neuromorphic computing system possessing compactness and compatibility of brain</b>.  Two pathways are highlighted by my former research experiences as promising ways leading to my aspiration:
* <b>Ultrafast nonlinear optics</b>: provides super-precision controlling and detection of physical systems, and has the potential to reach the compactness of atomic level through effects like quantum walks. My first attempt in this field is here: <a href="#Section4">Compact All-PM Fiber Femtosecond Laser</a>
* <b>Optical quantum information</b>: which allows the utilization of electromagnetic fields’ internal quantum properties, because various quantum EM phenomena like squeezed EM fields and entangled photon pairs are naturally wonderful carriers of intensive information.
<p>Besides, I seek inspirations from industrial engineering, interdisciplinary fields and international cooperations. Please have a cup of Espresso here: <a href="#Section3">LED-based Solar Simulators</a></p>
